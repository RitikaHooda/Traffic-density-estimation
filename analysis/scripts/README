plot.p : 
    This file is used for plotting the output graphs for density vs time. The variables to this program are 
	infile (string, specifies the name of the file which contains time in first column and density values in second problem)
	outfile (string, specifies the name of the output file)
	mname (string, specifies the method)
    Usage: gnuplot -e 'infile="output.txt"; outfile = "out.png"; mname = "Method 1"' plot.p
utility.cpp : 
    This file is used for finding utility given two output files. It takes in two arguments;
        name of method's output file
        name of baseline output file
    Usage: $  g++ -o myprogram utility.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
           $ ./myprogram outputfile1 outputfile2
plotg.p : 
     This file is used for plotting the utility vs time graph. The variables to this program are 
	infile (string, specifies the name of the file which contains method in first column, time in second column and utility values in second problem)
	outfile (string, specifies the name of the output file)
     Usage: gnuplot -e 'infile="ut.txt"; outfile = "utility_time.png"' plotg.p
