To use, $ make
	$ ./myprogram 'file_location' 'test_video_location'
where file_location is the location of the source image and test_video_location is the location of the traffic video. The program saves the output in the same folder. The output file contains two columns of values: "time(in seconds), density". This can be potted using plotting scripts given in analysis folder.
